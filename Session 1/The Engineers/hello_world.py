# Step 1: Print a message to the console
print("Hello Future Youth Zone Engineers!")

# Step 2: Let's make it more personal
name = input("What's your name? ")
print(f"Welcome to the lab, {name}!")

# Step 3: Check your Python version
import sys
print(f"\nYou're running Python {sys.version_info.major}.{sys.version_info.minor}")

# That's it! You've just written and executed your first Python program.
